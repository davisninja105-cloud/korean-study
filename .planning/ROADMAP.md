### 🚧 v1.5 Extraction Quality & Reliability (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Audit the extraction pipeline for card-quality issues (findings-first), harden the extraction code path so it produces well-formed, study-safe cards by construction, act on the audit evidence by improving and validating the prompt and fixing existing cards in place, then close two known reliability bugs from `CONCERNS.md`.

- [ ] **Phase 20: Extraction Pipeline Hardening** - Native structured outputs + code-enforced blank-safety in the extraction path
- [ ] **Phase 21: Card Database Quality Audit** - Read-only deterministic audit of the live deck → dated findings report
- [ ] **Phase 22: Findings-Driven Prompt Improvement & Corpus Fixes** - Revise/validate the prompt against the audit, then fix existing cards in place
- [ ] **Phase 23: Reliability Bug Fixes** - Log silent known-lemmas degradation; auto-relink forward-reference edges after clean sync

## Phase Details

### Phase 20: Extraction Pipeline Hardening

**Goal**: The card-extraction code path produces well-formed, study-safe cards by construction — native structured outputs replace text-JSON parsing, and blank-safety / zero-sentence rules are code-enforced rather than left to prompt instruction.
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of the audit; lands first per research — good early/parallel candidate)
**Requirements**: EXTRACT-01, EXTRACT-02, EXTRACT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `extractCardsFromNotes()` returns cards via native structured outputs (a zod schema + `output_config.format` / `zodOutputFormat`), reading `parsed_output` on the happy path instead of regex/salvage-parsing a text response
  2. A genuine mid-stream truncation still salvages the completed cards, with the salvage parser's JSON-depth check adjusted for the new `{ cards: [...] }` wrapper shape
  3. `parseExtractionResponse` rejects zero-sentence cards and drops sentences that fail `safeToBlank` (not merely `sentenceMatch().found`), so no card reaches the DB without a code-verified blank-safe first sentence
  4. Extraction over a sample lesson still dedups by `normalizedFront` and applies the `filterComponents` deck-lookup filter — no regression versus current output

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [ ] 20-01-PLAN.md — Wrapper-aware salvage parser + shared normalizeExtractedCards + code-enforced blank-safety (EXTRACT-02, EXTRACT-03)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [ ] 20-02-PLAN.md — Native structured outputs via zodOutputFormat/output_config with salvage fallback branching (EXTRACT-01)

**UI hint**: no

### Phase 21: Card Database Quality Audit

**Goal**: A trustworthy, read-only audit surfaces the real extraction-error classes present in the existing ~511-card deck, producing the dated evidence report that every downstream prompt/fix decision depends on.
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 20 — touches a different code path; may run in parallel)
**Requirements**: AUDIT-01, AUDIT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A read-only script runs against the live deck and writes a dated findings report to `.planning/audits/card-audit-<date>.md`
  2. The report covers blank-safety violations, zero-sentence cards, romanization leakage, distractor-count anomalies, `normalizedFront` inconsistency, and near-duplicate clusters
  3. All audit checks live in a pure, Vitest-covered `lib/audit-checks.ts` module that reuses production helpers (`sentenceMatch`, `splitParticle`, `normalizeFront`, `filterComponents`) rather than reimplementing them
  4. Running the audit mutates no data — it is verifiably read-only (no writes to the DB)

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: no

### Phase 22: Findings-Driven Prompt Improvement & Corpus Fixes

**Goal**: The audit findings are acted on end-to-end — the extraction prompt is revised against the evidence and validated on real lessons (before it is trusted), then high-confidence existing-card issues are corrected in place.
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (audit report + shared checks module drive the prompt review and the before/after validation) and Phase 20 (validation re-runs the hardened extraction path)
**Requirements**: PROMPT-01, PROMPT-02, FIX-01, FIX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The `extract-cards.ts` prompt is revised against the current card schema and the audit report, with each edit annotated to the specific error class it addresses
  2. A non-persisting `scripts/prompt-eval.mts` re-runs extraction on a sample of real lessons and diffs audit-check counts against a saved baseline, showing the targeted error classes drop before the prompt is considered final (no full-corpus re-run required)
  3. High-confidence quality issues are corrected in the database by mutating cards in place by `id` (dry-run-gated scripts, or `CardEditor` for one-offs) — never delete-and-recreate, preserving FSRS state and `ReviewLog` history
  4. Every fix script defaults to dry-run and requires an explicit `--apply` flag to write, matching the `retro-filter-cleanup.mts` pattern

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: no

### Phase 23: Reliability Bug Fixes

**Goal**: Two known reliability gaps from `CONCERNS.md` are closed — silent known-lemmas degradation becomes observable, and forward-reference dependency edges relink automatically after a clean sync, retiring the manual `relink-dependencies.mjs` step.
**Depends on**: Nothing (orthogonal to the audit/prompt/extraction track and self-contained; ordered last only because it is independent)
**Requirements**: RELIABILITY-01, RELIABILITY-02, RELIABILITY-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. When the known-lemmas query fails in `lib/study-cards.ts`, a `[study-cards]`-prefixed reason is logged before the code degrades to an empty Set — the existing `Promise.allSettled` graceful-degradation contract is preserved (a pool-query failure still 500s)
  2. A sync that completes with `failed === 0 && newLessons > 0` automatically relinks forward-reference `CardDependency` edges, replacing the manual `relink-dependencies.mjs` invocation
  3. The auto-relink pass is idempotent — running it after every qualifying sync produces no duplicate or incorrect edges

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: no

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 8.1 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 → 23

Within v1.5, the audit/prompt track is strictly serial (21 → 22); Phase 20 (extraction hardening) and Phase 23 (reliability bugs) are independent and may land anywhere in the sequence.
